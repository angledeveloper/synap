SYNAPSea\u2019s consumer behavior modeling revealed untapped price thresholds, driving a 32% revenue increase in the first quarter post-launch. When preparing to launch a flagship device in Asia, the client lacked pricing clarity across tier-2 cities. Furthermore, data privacy and security concerns are of the utmost importance, as implementing AI requires processing large amounts of sensitive data and requires robust cybersecurity measures to protect them against breaches and cyberattacks. A key trend shaping the market is the integration of AI with the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling smarter manufacturing processes. This convergence enables connected devices and sensors to collect and analyze data over time, optimize production, improve supply chain management, and improve quality control. The interaction between AI and IoT is fueling Industry 4.0, making manufacturing smarter, efficient and adaptable to changing market requirements.","search_by_title":"Search By Title","report_industry":"Industry","base_year":"Base Year data:","forecast_period":"Forecast Period:","filter_btn":"Clear Filters","view_report":"View Report","data":[{"id":149,"title":"The Global AI in Manufacturing Market 2025-2032: Drivers, Opportunities, & Strategic Forecasts The Global AI in Manufacturing Market 2025-2032: Drivers, Opportunities, & Strategic Forecasts....","introduction_description":"The manufacturing sector is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the integration of Artificial Intelligence.
